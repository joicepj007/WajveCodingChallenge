### Architecture Used:

MVVM(Model-View-ViewModel) with Clean architecture pattern used in this project.


### Advantages of Using Clean Architecture

- our code is even more easily testable than with plain MVVM.
- our code is further decoupled (the biggest advantage.)
- The package structure is even easier to navigate.
- The project is even easier to maintain.
- our team can add new features even more quickly.


### Advantages of MVVM

- Maintainability:

A clean separation of different kinds of code should make it easier to go into one or several of those more granular and focused parts and make changes without worrying.

That means we can remain agile and keep moving out to new releases quickly.

- Testability:

With MVVM each piece of code is more granular and if it is implemented right to our external and internal dependences are in separate pieces of code from the parts with the core logic that we would like to test.

That makes it a lot easier to write unit tests against a core logic.

- Extensibility :

It sometimes overlaps with maintainability, because of the clean separation boundaries and more granular pieces of code.

We have a better chance of making any of those parts more reusable.

And Our business logic is completely decoupled from our UI. It makes our code very easy to maintain and test.
